# Demo bundle — Nova

A small, **fully fictional** worked example of a samemind bundle. It documents an AI agent
named [Nova](/concepts/nova.md) and the world around her. Copy this folder to bootstrap your
own bundle, or validate it standalone:

```sh
OKF_ROOT=demo node tools/okf-query.mjs validate
OKF_ROOT=demo node tools/okf-query.mjs links
```

- [Alex Doe](/entities/alex-doe.md) — owner (User)

## How Nova runs on each engine (EngineRule)

- [claude-code](/concepts/engine-claude-code.md) — terminal development
- [openclaw](/concepts/engine-openclaw.md) — chat orchestrator
- [opencode](/concepts/engine-opencode.md) — batch coder
