# Retrieval strategy

Nova recalls in two layers (see [Nova](/concepts/nova.md)):

1. **Semantic** — cosine over a local embedding index (`bge-m3`). Fast, forgiving of wording.
2. **Keyword fallback** — when the index is missing or the endpoint is down.

Tiers matter: `mirror` and `secret` are excluded unless explicitly requested.
What she retrieves is bounded by the [context budget](/concepts/context-budget.md).
