Identity layer (docs/identity-layer.md): [\`_identity-template.md\`](_identity-template.md) —
the agent's own mind (one per bundle); [\`_engine-rule-template.md\`](_engine-rule-template.md) —
per-engine role/allowed/forbidden (one per engine). Assemble a compact brief from them:
\`npx samemind brief\`.

Work discipline (docs/work-discipline.md): [\`_decision-template.md\`](_decision-template.md) —
a decision and its context (append-only); [\`_session-template.md\`](_session-template.md) —
a session summary (\`## Done\` / \`## Decided\` / \`## Next\`).

Knowledge cycle (docs/knowledge-cycle.md): [\`_analysis-template.md\`](_analysis-template.md) —
a conclusion from observed facts (\`relations.informs\` → an Idea);
[\`_research-template.md\`](_research-template.md) — a deeper dig (\`spawned_by\` an
